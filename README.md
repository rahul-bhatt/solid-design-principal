# solid-design-principal
In object-oriented computer programming, the term SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by Robert C. Martin. Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development. The SOLID acronym was introduced by Michael Feathers.

1. Single responsibility principle: A class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be 
able to affect the specification of the class).

2. Open/closed principle: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

3. Liskov substitution principle: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

4. Interface segregation principle: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

5. Dependency inversion principle: One should depend upon abstractions and not concretions.
